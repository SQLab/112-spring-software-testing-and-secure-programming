## ASan Out-of-bound Write bypass Redzone
### Source code
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(){
    int a[8];
    int b[8];
    a[16] = 0xff;
    return 0;
}
```
### Why
redzone是在變數分配時在記憶體前後取一段記憶體加上防護偵測overflow，
此例a、b皆為32bytes，a右側與b左側都為redzone，對齊記憶體排列及設計該段redzone為32bytes，
故a[8]~a[15]為redzone，a[16] == b[0]。
