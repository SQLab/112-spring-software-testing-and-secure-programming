### Heap out-of-bounds
#### Source code
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int)); // Allocate memory

    *ptr = 42;
    *(ptr + 1) = 43; // Out-of-bounds access

    free(ptr);
    return 0;
}

## ASan Out-of-bound Write bypass Redzone
### Source code
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
  int a[8];
  int b[8];

  a[16] = 16;

  printf("a[16]: %d\n", a[16]);  
  printf("b[0]: %d\n", b[0]);   

  return 0;
}
```
### Why
ASan may not detect the error because the out-of-bounds `a` write overwrites an adjacent stack-allocated array `b`, bypassing redzone protection for stack allocations.
